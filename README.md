I am a `Java` developer with **8+** years of experience in Web and middleware application development.

I have been working with popular java frameworks like [Struts2](https://struts.apache.org/) and **[Spring](https://spring.io/)** and built systems with various complexity and criticalities with 0 Production fallbacks or post-production bugs.

I have experience working alone and with teams of upto 4 members communicating directly with client representatives and/or onsite team members. I also have experience with -
1. planning high level project architecture
2. building application wire-frames
3. writing technical documentation
4. creating project plans & delivery schedules

I have proven skills to learn while on the job and producing acceptable results while finding ways to enhance and improve pace and quality of delivery.

I also contribute as an active member in a group of Technical advisors and Quality Assurance in our current project for my current [employer](https://www.cognizant.com/india).
