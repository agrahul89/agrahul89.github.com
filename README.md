## Rahul Agarwal
I am a `Java` developer with **8+** years of experience in Web and middleware application development.

I have been working with popular java frameworks like [Struts2](https://struts.apache.org/) and **[Spring](https://spring.io/)** and built systems with various complexity and criticalities with 0 Production fallbacks or post-production bugs.
